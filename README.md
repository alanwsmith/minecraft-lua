Lua Programs For CC Tweaked (Computer Craft) in Minecraft

## Bootstrapping

Type in the "bootstrap_template.lua" file manually
with the path to the process start you want to 
use

I save it as "bootstrap.lua" and then copy it 
over to "startup.lua" in case I make a mistake. 
That keeps the content from being wiped out
and having to start over completely.

After the starup.lua content is in place, 
reboot the computer twice. The first time
pulls down the actually startup.lua file
and the second time runs it

Keeping "bootstrap.lau" also allows for getting
the main "startup.lau" back if it
gets messed up
